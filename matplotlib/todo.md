# Future Work

*Medium Priority*

Matplotlib interactive features
* Widgets - weak event handling
* Event Handling (this requires special backend. jupyter notebook won't work.)
* Animation - no human intervention

*Low Priority*

* APIs <br/>
    * projections (should be learned along with geopandas package)
    * Subfigure (experimental as of 3.5.0. waiting until it matures)
* All kinds of plots
    * Triangulation & Tri-contour(f)
    * LightSource & Sankey
* Matplotlib toolkits (mainly layout)
    * axes_grid1
    * axisartist
    * axes_grid (legacy)
    * 3D plotting (nothing really interests me at the moment) - `mplot3d`
* Others
    * Should I create my own mplstyle file and rc file? (inspiration e.g. ggplot2 colors)
